I promise to cherish every moment with you, to hold your hand through life's ups and downs, and to love you more with each passing day. And yeah I know that we've both hurt each other, but its not that matters. What matters is that we choose each other constantly! And I CHOOSE YOU! You make my world complete, and I'm incredibly grateful to have you in my life."
